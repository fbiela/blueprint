    <h1>About.<small> bem vindo!</small></h1>
    <p>Small talk is an informal type of discourse that does not cover any
       functional topics of conversation or any transactions that need to be
       addressed.</p>
    <p>Small talk is conversation for its own sake. The phenomenon of small
       talk was initially studied in 1923 by Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski, who coined
       the term "phatic communication" to describe it. The ability to conduct
       small talk is a social skill; hence, small talk is some type of social
       communication. Early publications assume networked work positions as
       suitable for social communication.</p>
